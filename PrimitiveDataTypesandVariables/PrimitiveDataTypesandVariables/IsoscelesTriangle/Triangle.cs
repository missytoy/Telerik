//Problem 8. Isosceles Triangle

//Write a program that prints an isosceles triangle of 9 copyright symbols ©, something like this:
//   ©
//  © ©
// ©   ©
//© © © ©
//Note: The © symbol may be displayed incorrectly at the console so you may need to change the console character encoding to UTF-8 and assign a Unicode-friendly font in the console.
//Note: Under old versions of Windows the © symbol may still be displayed incorrectly, regardless of how much effort you put to fix it.

using System;
class Triangle
{

    static void Main()
    {
        Console.OutputEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8;
        char symbol = '\u00A9';
        Console.WriteLine("{0,4}\n{0,3}{0,2}\n{0,2}{0,4}\n{0}{0,2}{0,2}{0,2}", symbol);

    }
}
